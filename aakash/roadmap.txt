# 📘 API Usage Tracking & Billing SaaS - Solo Developer Plan

---

## 1. The Real Problem Developers Face

Small API providers (startups, indie developers) have no easy way to:

* Track how much each user consumes their API
* Prevent overuse or abuse
* Bill users based on API usage
* Generate monthly usage reports
* Avoid revenue loss from heavy users

---

## 2. The Solution: Your API Usage Tracking & Billing Layer

Your SaaS product will:

* Track API usage per user (user-wise API call count)
* Summarize monthly API call counts automatically
* Generate usage-based bills for their users
* Let developers monitor their API users and usage patterns
* Be affordable, simple, and developer-friendly
* Allow small startups to track and monetize their APIs easily

---

## 3. Technical Stack

* **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js framework)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Hosting**: Railway / Render / VPS (low-cost)
* **Frontend (Optional)**: Basic React or simple HTML dashboard (can skip for MVP)
* **Authentication**: JWT or API Key-based system
* **Deployment (Optional Advanced)**: Docker for containerization

---

## 4. PostgreSQL Schema Design

**Tables:**

1. **users**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * email
   * api\_key
   * status (active/suspended)
   * created\_at

2. **api\_usage\_logs**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * user\_id (Foreign Key → users.id)
   * endpoint (Which API endpoint was called)
   * timestamp

3. **monthly\_usage\_summary**

   * id
   * user\_id
   * month\_year (Format: YYYY-MM)
   * total\_calls

4. **billing\_invoices**

   * id
   * user\_id
   * month\_year
   * total\_calls
   * bill\_amount
   * status (paid/unpaid)

## 5. Monthly Running Cost (Infra Only) - No Development Cost Included

| Item                       | Cost                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Shared VPS Hosting         | Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 3,000/month                     |
| PostgreSQL Cloud DB        | Often included with VPS or + Rs. 500             |
| Total Estimated Infra Cost | Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000/month (for startup scale) |

---

## 6. Revenue Expectation (Realistic for Solo Developer in Year 1)

**Timeline:**

| Time            | Revenue Estimate                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Month 1-2       | Rs. 0 (Development phase)                  |
| Month 3-4       | Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 5,000/month (5-10 users)  |
| Month 6 onwards | Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000/month (20+ users) |

This will depend on your hustle in user outreach and marketing.

---

## 7. How to Get Users (First 10-20 Users)

* **Reddit**: Communities like r/SaaS, r/webdev, r/startups
* **IndieHackers.com**: Share build-in-public posts
* **LinkedIn**: DM startup founders, backend developers
* **Twitter/X**: Post updates with #buildinpublic hashtag
* **Dev.to**: Publish blogs like "Why you need API usage tracking"
* **Cold Emails/DMs**: Target small API-based SaaS businesses
* **Discord Developer Groups**: API, Node.js, SaaS startup communities

**Target Audience:**
Indie developers, small SaaS startups, early-stage API products.

---

## 8. Final Summary and Motivation

✅ You **CAN build this alone with 6 months of backend experience**.

✅ Keep your first version **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**.

✅ Focus on:

* API key authentication
* Logging API usage
* Monthly aggregation
* Simple billing calculation
* Outreach for early users

✅ Once 5-10 users start using it → improve the product → grow slowly.

---

## ✅ Next Step (Optional):

If you want:
I can help you with:

* A full **2-month project task roadmap**
* **Swagger/OpenAPI docs** for your SaaS
* **Marketing website copy** for your landing page

👉 Just tell me:
**“Yes, give next roadmap”**
Or
**“Help me start coding part”**
