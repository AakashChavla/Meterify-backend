Perfect! Below is your **2-Month Solo Developer Roadmap** for building your **API Usage Tracking & Billing SaaS (NestJS + PostgreSQL)**.

---

# ðŸš€ 2-Month Solo Developer Roadmap (MVP Launch Plan)

---

## âœ… Month 1: Core Backend API + Database Layer

---

### Week 1: Project Setup & Basic API Skeleton

* âœ… Setup NestJS project (use TypeScript, latest version)
* âœ… Setup PostgreSQL locally or on Railway/Render
* âœ… Setup TypeORM or Prisma (your choice) for DB ORM
* âœ… Design and create PostgreSQL database schema:

| Table                   | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| users                   | Stores API users                 |
| api\_usage\_logs        | Tracks every API call            |
| monthly\_usage\_summary | Stores monthly aggregated counts |
| billing\_invoices       | Stores billing data              |

* âœ… Setup basic REST routes for:

| Route               | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| POST /users         | Create user with API Key                    |
| GET /users          | List all users                              |
| GET /usage/\:userId | Get usage stats for user                    |
| POST /logs          | Track API usage log (simulate real API hit) |

---

### Week 2: API Usage Logging + API Key Authentication

* âœ… Implement API Key middleware for authentication
* âœ… Every incoming API call â†’ Log entry in `api_usage_logs`
* âœ… Store fields like: user\_id, endpoint, timestamp
* âœ… Implement daily cron job (Nest Schedule module) to auto-aggregate daily data
* âœ… Start testing with Postman / Thunder Client

---

### Week 3: Monthly Usage Summary + Billing Logic

* âœ… Create cron job for monthly usage summarization
* âœ… Generate data into `monthly_usage_summary`
* âœ… Auto-calculate bill amount (e.g., â‚¹1 per 1000 calls)
* âœ… Generate billing records into `billing_invoices`
* âœ… API endpoints for:

| Route                 | Purpose                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| GET /billing/\:userId | Get user's billing history |
| GET /summary/\:userId | Monthly usage summary      |

---

### Week 4: Simple Admin & User APIs (Optional Frontend Later)

* âœ… Basic NestJS Admin-only routes to:

| Route               | Purpose           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| GET /admin/users    | View all users    |
| GET /admin/logs     | View usage logs   |
| GET /admin/invoices | View all invoices |

* âœ… JWT-based simple admin auth OR hardcoded token for MVP
* âœ… Manual data export (CSV/JSON) for now

---

## âœ… Month 2: Monitoring, Testing, Deployment & Marketing Prep

---

### Week 5: Testing + Error Handling + Logging

* âœ… Add error handling (400, 401, 500 errors)
* âœ… Add global NestJS exception filters
* âœ… Add logging (Nest Logger or Winston)
* âœ… Unit test for critical endpoints

---

### Week 6: Deployment

* âœ… Deploy backend on Render / Railway (Free / Low-cost VPS)
* âœ… Deploy PostgreSQL (managed or Railway Postgres)
* âœ… Setup environment variables (for DB, API secrets)
* âœ… Test deployment URL with Postman

---

### Week 7: Create Marketing & Landing Page (Optional Frontend)

* âœ… Simple HTML / React frontend (if you want)

* âœ… Content on landing page:

  * Problem it solves
  * Features
  * Sample Pricing
  * Signup form (collect emails or API key generation)

* âœ… Integrate Email collection tool (or just Google Form link for now)

---

### Week 8: User Outreach Phase

* âœ… Prepare your "early access" DM / Email template
* âœ… Post on:

| Platform     | Action                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| IndieHackers | Build in public post                      |
| Reddit       | Share on r/webdev, r/SaaS                 |
| LinkedIn     | Message 50 small SaaS founders            |
| Twitter/X    | Post weekly build updates                 |
| Discord      | Share in SaaS/startup/Node.js communities |

* âœ… Offer **Free Beta access for first 10 users**

---

## âœ… Tools Youâ€™ll Need Along the Way

| Task            | Tool                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hosting         | Render / Railway                    |
| DB              | PostgreSQL                          |
| API Docs        | Swagger                             |
| Testing         | Postman / Thunder Client            |
| Version Control | GitHub                              |
| Deployment      | Railway / Docker (optional for now) |

---

## âœ… Whatâ€™s NOT Required (MVP First)

* No need for complex UI dashboards (start with APIs only)
* No complex DevOps (use Railway/Render for now)
* No payment gateway yet (you can send manual invoices first)

---

## âœ… Final Tip:

ðŸ‘‰ **Start building backend immediately**
ðŸ‘‰ **Focus on working API and core logic**
ðŸ‘‰ **Start posting progress online weekly (build-in-public style)**
ðŸ‘‰ **Talk to early users while coding**
